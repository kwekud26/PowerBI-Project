##  Project Overview
This project visualizes airline performance using U.S. domestic flight data provided by Maven Analytics. The interactive Power BI dashboard identifies patterns in delays, cancellations, and reliability by city, airline, and date.

---

##  Project Scope
- Analyzes over 6 million commercial flights  
- Categorizes flight status: on-time, delayed, canceled  
- Highlights delay and cancellation reasons  
- Compares cities and carriers across the U.S.

---

##  Business Objective
Deliver clear, actionable insights for:
- **Airline Operations Teams** to reduce delays and cancellations  
- **Airport Authorities** to optimize logistics  
- **Travelers** to understand airline reliability  

---

##  Document Purpose
This project was developed to showcase real-world data analysis and dashboard creation skills using Power BI, and to demonstrate value-added storytelling with data for business use cases.

---

##  Use Case
**Scenario:**  
An airline executive is preparing for quarterly planning and needs to know which days, cities, and airlines experience the most disruptions. This dashboard allows leadership to explore that performance breakdown quickly.

---

##  Skills Demonstrated
- Power BI Report Design  
- Data Modeling & Relationships  
- DAX for KPIs and Measures  
- Power Query (ETL)  
- Insight Narration and Visualization  
- GitHub Documentation & Versioning  

---

##  Data Source
- **Provider:** [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/)  
- **Format:** Excel spreadsheet  
- **Fields:** Flight status, airline, origin/destination, date, delay and cancellation reasons

---

##  Data Cleaning and Processing
- Filtered non-commercial flights  
- Re-labeled cancellation codes (e.g., weather, security, carrier)  
- Handled missing and blank fields  
- Created DAX measures for:
  - Delay %
  - Cancellation rate by reason  
  - On-time performance metrics  

---

##  Data Analysis and Insights
- **United Airlines** had the highest delay rate: `49.69%`  
- **Weather** accounted for `54.35%` of all cancellations  
- **Sunday** recorded the most cancellations overall  
- **Chicago** and **Atlanta** were the busiest hubs

---

##  Recommendation
- Airlines should adopt predictive analytics to flag likely delays  
- Airports can better staff high-risk days and routes  
- Improve collaboration between airlines and weather/traffic control authorities

---

##  Conclusion
With Power BI and clean DAX measures, this project transforms raw airline data into a usable and interactive business intelligence tool. The result is a professional, data-driven dashboard that supports real-time decisions.

---

##  Built With
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- **Power Query** for ETL  
- **DAX** for calculated KPIs  
- **Maven Analytics Dataset**  
- *(Planned)*: **OpenAI GPT‑4** for auto-generating report summaries

---

##  Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate GPT‑4 for insight narration (summary text box in Power BI)  
- [ ] Automate data refresh using Power Automate  
- [ ] Embed live dashboard on portfolio site  
- [ ] Add advanced trend prediction (time series forecasting)
