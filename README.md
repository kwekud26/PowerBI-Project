## Project Overview
The Domestic Airline Flight Status Dashboard is a Power BI visualization project analyzing U.S. domestic flights using data provided by Maven Analytics. It highlights trends in delays, cancellations, and overall airline performance.

---

## Project Scope
This project focuses on:
- Over 6 million domestic flights
- Performance metrics: on-time, delayed, or canceled
- Breakdown of cancellation reasons
- Comparison of airlines and cities based on flight activity

---

##  Business Objective
To provide meaningful insights for:
- Airline operations teams to improve efficiency
- Airport authorities to better manage logistics
- Travelers to understand airline reliability

---

## Document Purpose
This document presents the dashboard’s development process, insights, and value as part of my Power BI portfolio — demonstrating real-world analytics and visualization skills.

---

## Use Case
**Scenario:**  
An airline executive wants to understand where performance gaps exist — which routes, days, or carriers are underperforming and why. This dashboard offers a quick and clear overview to support strategic decisions.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Power BI Dashboard Design
- Data Modeling & Relationships
- DAX for KPIs and Measures
- Power Query (ETL)
- Insight Extraction
- Report Documentation & GitHub Versioning

---

##  Data Source
-  **Source:** Maven Analytics  
-  The dataset was part of a data challenge and includes flight-level information such as:
  - Airline
  - Flight Status
  - Delay % and cancellation codes
  - Origin & destination cities
- Provided in Excel format and imported into Power BI for modeling

---

## Data Cleaning and Processing
- Filtered for domestic, commercial flights
- Standardized cancellation descriptions
- Removed nulls, blanks, and unnecessary columns
- Created calculated columns and measures for:
  - % Delayed
  - % On-Time
  - % Canceled by Reason and Airline

---

## Data Analysis and Insight
- United Airlines had the highest delay rate: **49.69%**
- Weather caused **54.35%** of all flight cancellations
- Sundays had the highest cancellation rates
- Chicago and Atlanta were the busiest flight hubs

---

## Recommendation
- Airlines should invest in predictive analytics to proactively manage delay risks
- Airports can increase staff and resource allocation on high-risk days
- Better coordination with weather tracking and traffic control authorities

---

## Conclusion
Using Power BI, I turned Maven Analytics' dataset into a professional dashboard that empowers decision-makers in the airline industry with quick, actionable insights.
